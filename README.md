# 👋 Hi, I’m Shobhit Pachauri

## 🚀 About Me

I’m a **Data Scientist and Product Analyst in the making**, currently completing my **Master’s in Business Analytics & Artificial Intelligence** at **The University of Texas at Dallas**. With a foundation in **data science, machine learning, and product analytics**, I thrive on turning data into real-world impact.

Amazon Experience – Story
"At Amazon, I was part of the Advertising team where I worked closely with digital campaigns for some of the biggest global brands. Although my title was Senior Content Reviewer, my day-to-day responsibilities were quite analytical and strategic. I had to understand how ads were performing, identify issues, and improve them using data insights—essentially balancing both business goals and policy enforcement. This skill is applicable for any type of analyst roles. I had to utilize limited resources, and come up with strategies to maximize performance or returns.
What made the role interesting was how cross-functional it was. I wasn’t just checking for violations; I was collaborating with different stakeholders to improve ad effectiveness. I used SQL and Excel a lot to analyze ad performance and report on trends. SQL was to work on data wrangling, preparation, cleaning etc. 
 I worked on improving CPC [Cost-Per-Click, a key performance metric that indicates how much an advertiser pays per user click on an ad]. To do this, I experimented with different types of keywords and ad placements to see what performed better. We were basically trying to find the most efficient combination that would get more relevant clicks without increasing the budget.
To validate what worked best, I used A/B testing [a method of comparing two variations to see which one performs better based on a specific metric]. So, we tested different versions of ad layouts, messaging, or placements to understand what resonated more with users. This helped us make data-backed decisions that improved user engagement.
Another key part of that project was building dashboards that told a story. Instead of just giving raw data, I focused on how to translate insights into something leadership could act on.
